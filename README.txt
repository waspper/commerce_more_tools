# commerce_more_tools
Several addons for Drupal commerce sites.

By default, Drupal Commerce lacks some important features where a
marketplace or "multi-store" model is strictly required. For example,
granularity of permissions for certain entity types like Orders and
Payments. So, this module is intended to provide the mentioned improvements.

# Features
* More granular permissions for each order type, per store type.
* More granular permissions to handle order item types per store type.
* More granular permissions to handle payments per store type.
